# Apriori-Algorithm
## Description
This **Apriori Algorithm** implementation was created to help explain how the frequent-itemset counting algorithm works and provide non-computer science students with an accessible, interactive visualization of its application. 

This simple program also serves as a good baseline introduction to Visual Basic for Applications, especially for those with little-to-no coding experience. 

## Usage

---
* Hit the "Trick or Treat" button to simulate candy collection
* Hit the black run button to perform frequent-itemset identification
* The "Min Support Threshold" is a user-input variable dictating the criteria for itemset frequency 
* Pruning can be toggled on or off to observe its effect
